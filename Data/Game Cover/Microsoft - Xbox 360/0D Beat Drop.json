0D Beat Drop is a falling block puzzle game with musical elements similar to the Lumines titles (the beat matching system from those titles was licensed for 0D Beat Drop). But rather than scenic design, the player needs to combine the puzzling with matching the beat as an essential part of the gameplay. The basic layout is similar to Tetris. There is a playing field where groups of three pieces in a square of four tiles drop. To the right the next groups can be previewed and there is also a beat meter that moves along with the game's music. The goal is to avoid having the stacked pieces reaching the top of the screen.
The groups drop and can be moved around and rotated. They need to be positioned to form matches of three identical pieces: horizontal, vertical or in an L-shape. These do not disappear right away when formed, but only when you perform a Beat Drop. When the pieces are dropped with a separate button when the beat meter is near the top of the bar, the matched pieces disappear, additional points are scored and a multiplier is built up. Timing it wrong does not clear anything, even if there are matches on the playing field. While the multiplier builds up, it becomes harder to match the beat and perform a Beat Drop. Eliminated pieces become shadow pieces and are sent to the opponent's playfield, similar to the Puyo Puyo games, as most game modes focus on competitive play against a friend or AI opponent. A good player will first stack up chains and then perform a large Beat Drop to attack the opponent, but due to the increased difficulty of making a successful drop at a high multiplier, there is a risk of missing it. In that case, all the shadow pieces end up on your own playfield. When you create a chain when the opponent is about to send you those pieces, you can create a chain yourself to counter and clear the pieces right away. Shadow pieces are shown as hollow objects and can still be used regularly to create chains.
Advanced players can enter the Hyper Mode. When you allow shadow pieces to fall into your playfield twice, consecutively, without performing a beat drop, this mode is activated (with at least 42 shadow pieces). At that moment it is possible to make a huge comeback or risk it all.
